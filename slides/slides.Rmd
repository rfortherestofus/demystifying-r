# Who am I?

???

- Not a hardcore quant: anthro PhD
- Starting using R when I was consulting so I could have a free option to replace Excel, SPSS, etc. Realized R was much more than that.
- Use R for descriptive stats, data visualization, creative reporting
- Realized the power of R and realized people are scared of it. Started RRU to offer training through online courses, training orgs, workshops, etc to help the rest of us learn R.

# Why Use R?

???

- Many people are attracted to it because it's free
- It can do what you already do AND it can do more
- I'll provide three reasons to use R today

```



```{r eval = FALSE}
nhanes %>% 
  skim(weight)
```
