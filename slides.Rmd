## Download and Install R

The first thing you need to do is download the R software. Go to the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (aka “CRAN”) website](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/) and download the software for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

## Data Analysis

---

### Import Data

```{r echo = FALSE}
nhanes <- read_csv(here("data", "nhanes.csv"))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
nhanes <- read_csv("data/nhanes.csv")
```

--

```{r echo = FALSE}
nhanes
```



---

### Data Analysis

```{r eval = FALSE}
nhanes %>% 
  count(education)
```

--

```{r echo = FALSE}
nhanes %>% 
  count(education)
```

---

### Data Analysis

```{r}
physically_active_education <- nhanes %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarize(days_active = mean(phys_active_days, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(days_active = round(days_active, 1)) %>% 
  drop_na(education)
```

--

```{r echo = FALSE}
physically_active_education
```

## Reproducibility

---

### RMarkdown

Go from data import to final report, all in one tool.

---


### RMarkdown

Every RMarkdown document has the following:

--

1. **YAML** (one per document)

--

2. **Text** (repeated as many times as necessary)

--

3. **Code chunks** (repeated as many times as necessary)
